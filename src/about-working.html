Love using computers to do cool shit.

Hi I'm jonathan. Love to do cool (fun interesting) shit with computers. People pay me to do all kinds of shit.

Jy menu of services - kind of work (dev stuff) I want to do for people Cool to do something similar for digital media (content production) for hxgf

tinder bio - Want to meet cool down to earth human beings. I‚Äôm Not entirely optimistic, but let‚Äôs see what happens.



i move slowly and (surely)(meticulously)(thoughtfully)

Ambitious, pragmatic, time constrained I love technology and programming but I‚Äôm a busy guy with a family and a life. I need to make good decisions about how I spend my time, er go, I don‚Äôt spend a ton of leisure time writing code and picking up new tools just for the sake of. climbing and spending time with my friends and family will always take precedent over learning es6

jy bio - self-taught developer (learned what i need to know as i've needed to know it...school of hard knocks) (i know A LOT about A LOT of stuff, but i don't have a CS degree ... i'm a designer who wanted to make web pages do cool tricks!) full-stack** ** how full is your stack? (diagrams of the architectures i work on and where i usually work "in the stack" (stack includes back end, front end, design, ux, and business managers, users, marketing)


in search of: people who want to build ethical and sustainable products and services based on open source software

I'm a pretty good developer. I'm not the BEST developer but I'm also good at ux and marketing and design and branding

there are TONS of people WAY more talented than me in any given area (design, development, music, art, etc) but i'm a good combination of a lot of things in one convenient (and attractive üòâ) package


Best way to assess my skills: ask me to do something! I‚Äôm really good at assessing needs and delivering solutions I adapt to new tech & concepts quickly, adhering as closely as possible to ‚Äúbest standards‚Äù

I get nervous and start rambling when I‚Äôm put on the spot, It‚Äôs difficult to accurately convey my strengths and abilities in an interview setting.

OLD BIO FODDER






I am a very scatterbrained person. I have a hard time focusing on A) things that don‚Äôt interest me, B) only one thing. It‚Äôs difficult for me to do something unless there are a million other things floating around in my head/psyche

I am a non linear thinker Anything linear that I create (writing, songs, videos, ‚Äúart‚Äù) has been edited to shit half a million times It takes me forever to get to the point when I‚Äôm talking to people / telling a story because in the process of speaking tons of (often irrelevant) details keep coming to mind I do dumb shit all the time without thinking of the consequences bc brain is like ‚Äúwell what if ...‚Äù

dopamine-driven development I‚Äôm a developer because it‚Äôs fun! I started doing this stuff because of all the dopamine. i don't love "writing code", i love writing shitty code to make things It‚Äôs very rewarding to solve problems and be productive, and there‚Äôs a romantic element of ‚Äúhacker‚Äù aesthetic to it seeing things and thinking "i want to make that" (started with video, music, art, web sites, libraries, software/tools, utilities/resources) everything gives me ideas, i can't stop

```
i don't want to waste time doing stuff (using technology) that isn't fun (doesn't spark joy, etc)
react/vue/es6/typescript don't spark joy

```

i'm not an expert at one thing in particular, but i'm pretty good at A LOT of things. my skillset makes me good at (full stack web - server operations to app dev, video, audio[podcast/ads], graphic design [in any medium, web, native app/ui, posters, stickers, idk other print/page layout?)

one day, people will be gathered in a room talking about me (it's a funeral or memorial service)

and they will say

that guy was fucking insane but he meant well and we loved him <3 whatever the web development equivalent of a shadetree mechanic is ... that's me
